Main files 

hamiltonian.py
-exact diagonalization code 

Peridoic.py
input.txt
testing.txt
-periodic CC system code with txt files for changing parameters

functions
-contains functions that both Hamiltonian or periodic could use such as p to m conversion

Non_Periodic
-non periodic CC system code uses same txt files

Other files

ham_no_csv
-alternate way to make Hamiltonian that calls shaeer's rotor code instead of using csv files

ham pandas test
-uses pandas instead of csv to go trough files
-doesn't seem to make a difference

transform_test
-basis transformation for Hamiltonian

ham_new_basis
-seems to be similar to transform test
-not 100% what i used it for

braket Hamiltonian 
-creates pqrs states and p'q'r's states Hamiltonian

plot_points_generator
-creates csv files from CC code for plot points to use

plot points
-uses csv files from generator 

g_finder
-finds value of g for which periodic diverges

cc_txt_gen
-automates collecting energy values from different g values

dmrg_csv_gen
-creates csv files containing g and energy values for various sites and basis size
